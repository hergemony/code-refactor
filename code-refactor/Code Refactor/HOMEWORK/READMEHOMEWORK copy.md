01 HTML, CSS, and GIT: Code Refactor

HEY THERE!

This mini-project will showcase "Refactoring" which involves improving an existing code in order to make it more accessible. 

"Accessibility" ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboaards. By enhancing a websites accessibility, it will have a higher search engine ranking and reduce risk of litigation.

Emphasis will be made on the alt attribute. The "alt" attribute is defined in a set of tags (namely, img, area and optionally for input and applet) to allow you to provide a text equivalent for the object.

A text equivalent brings the following benefits to your website and its visitors in the following common situations:

nowadays, Web browsers are available in a very wide variety of platforms with very different capacities; some cannot display images at all or only a restricted set of type of images; some can be configured to not load images. If your code has the alt attribute set in its images, most of these browsers will display the description you gave instead of the images
some of your visitors cannot see images, be they blind, color-blind, low-sighted; the alt attribute is of great help for those people that can rely on it to have a good idea of what's on your page
search engine bots belong to the two above categories: if you want your website to be indexed as well as it deserves, use the alt attribute to make sure that they won't miss important sections of your pages.



This file will contain my version of HORISEON mock up entitled HERGEMONY.


Please see screenshot below of sample CSS file:

body {
    background-color: #d9dcd6;
}
  /* Adds title and padding to the top */
.header {
    padding: 55px;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #560bad;
    color: #ffffff;
