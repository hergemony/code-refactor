## The CODE REFACTOR ##
# Exploring HTML, CSS and GIT #

HEY THERE!

This project was to learn about CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) and explore what each CSS element is doing within the web application. It is designed to improve understanding of the aspects that are affected by html and css lines of code including how the boxes, containers and colours adjust.


This file will contain my version of HORISEON mock up entitled HERGEMONY.
