## The CODE REFACTOR ##
# Exploring HTML, CSS and GIT #

HEY THERE! 👋🧑‍💻

This project explores how HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) elements interact on a web application. It is designed to improve a developer's understanding of the aspects that are affected by HTML and CSS lines of code including how the boxes, containers, sizes, colours and so on adjust to give a better visual experience for the user. All elements on the page need to be organized and sized effectively as to fit neat within the page.


This file will contain my version of HORISEON mock up entitled HERGEMONY.
